# Recursion

Recursion is a technique to solve a problem by calling function itself for multiple times. <br>
Recursion uses different inputs on same operation to get optimal result. <br>
Base condition is necessary while using recusion else it will eventually convert into infinite loop. <br>

<b>Use</b>

Recursion is mainly used with non-linear data structures such as graph and trees.

<b>Prons :</b>

- Easy to code
- Used for graph and trees

<b> Cons : </b>

- Higher time complexity
- Higher space complexity

Two things are required while writing recursion code :
1. Method that calls itself
2. Condition that helps code to exit from infinite loop

Recursion code trick in 3 easy steps:
1. Convert mathematical equation into code
2. Set base condition to secure your code from infinite loop
3. Remove unexpected stops
